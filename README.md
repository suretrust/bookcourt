Bookourt is a mobile first web app built with react and rails. The react front end fetches data from rails REST API backend as well as posts data to it as appropriate. Full authentication is not required and there is no admin panel to add new courts at this time but these are features I plan to implement in the future. It is an app that helps you book available tennis courts from any part of the world. In this app, you can check your future and past bookings as well as search for a court to book by name.
